#  Overview of the principle 

>  In order to obtain two intersecting lines in three-dimensional space, here we use the point direction to represent the line, and create the intersection of the line through the two points and their normal vector. The specific operations are as follows: (1) Determine the axial direction. Here we use the normal vector 

           n 

           1 

          , 

           n 

           2 

         n_1,n_2 

     N1, n2 are cross-multiplied to determine the axial vector 

          A

     A. (2) Combine the two parameter lines 

           P 

           1 

          + 

          t 

           n 

           1 

         P_1 +tn_1 

     P1 + tn1 Pal 

           P 

           2 

          + 

          t 

           n 

           2 

         P_2 +tn_2 

     P2 + tn2 project along the axis to 

          A 

          â‹… 

          x 

          = 

          0 

         AÂ·x = 0 

     A ðŸ¥° x = 0 plane, so that you can create a situation where two straight lines intersect. (3) Derive the formula to find the intersection point of the projected two straight lines. The specific process is as follows: 

>  Since the normal vector is 

           n 

           1 

          , 

           n 

           2 

         n_1,n_2 

     N1, n2 are cross-multiplied, so after the two parameter lines are projected, the direction vector does not change, it is still the same

     After P1, P2 projection becomes
