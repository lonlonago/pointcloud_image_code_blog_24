I read an article before that used the PCA method to rotate the point cloud to improve the computational speed of the convex hull of an object. I found it interesting, so I tested it. 

#  I. Introduction 

>  PCA, as a dimensionality reduction method, can be used to analyze the main direction of the data to construct a new coordinate space. For the main ideas, please refer to the article https://blog.csdn.net/dayuhaitang1/article/details/108778144 

#  Code implementation 

 ```python
