#  Overview of the principle 

>  In the point cloud model, a certain number of data points are randomly selected and randomly shifted along the normal vector direction by a certain distance to obtain the noise points of the point cloud entity. The amplitude of the offset is related to the scale of the point cloud, and the offset distance obeys the Gaussian distribution.
